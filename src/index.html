        I started working as a software engineer back in 2018, right after finishing my psychology studies. Totally
        logical transition, right? Since then, I've been working on various projects, mostly web applications. Want to
        know more about my professional journey? Check out <a href="@myPortfolioURL">my portfolio</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
        So, did you check out my portfolio? Cool, right? I mean, not only is it a web page, but you can also turn it
        into a PDF! Yeah, I made that. 🧙‍♂️✨ I'm basically a magician. Oh, and did I mention I’m also a pretty good
        person? I'm such a good person, I'll let you create your own portfolio page—just like mine. Click the button
        below to get started.
