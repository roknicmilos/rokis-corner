        My name is Miloš Rokić, a.k.a. Roki.

        I started working as a software engineer back in 2018, right after finishing my psychology studies.
        Totally logical transition, right? Want to know more about my professional journey? Check out
        <a href="@myPortfolioURL">my portfolio</a>.

        So, did you check out my portfolio? Cool, right? I mean, not only is it a web page, but you can also turn it
        into a PDF! Yeah, I made that. 🧙‍♂️✨ I'm basically a magician. Oh, and did I mention I’m also a pretty good
        person? I'm such a good person, I'll let you create your own portfolio page—just like mine. Click the button
        below to get started.
